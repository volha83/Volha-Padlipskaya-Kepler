        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Volha Padlipskaya. I'm originally from Belarus. I have
          Economist Manager Diploma and Software Engineer Diploma.
          <br />For a long time I worked at OJSC Belarusian Steel Works as a
          software engineer. <br />
          In 2021, my family and I moved to the United States. <br />And this is
          the fourth year we have been living in Charlotte, NC.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's very difficult to adapt and get used to a new country, but I try
          to do my best as productively as possible. I am very open and friendly
          person.
          <br />I get in touch with people very easily. I love learning new
          things and improving my skills. <br />I always finish a task, no
          matter how difficult it is, and I never stop in the middle. A new
          challenge and new difficulties always wake me up and aim for results.
        </p>
        <p>
          After moving to the USA, I am studing English and really want to
          suplement my knowledge in programming so that I can develop here as a
          programmer in my favorite field.
          <br />Right now, all my efforts are focused on studying in Code The
          Dream. And I hope my plans and dreams will come true soon!
